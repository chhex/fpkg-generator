# fpkg-generator

Explorative Prototype for a F-Package Generator according to the document "Path towards a Service Architecture"

Process:

* Explore if https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/sql/plsql is feasible for parsing F-Package Specs.
* Identify a suitable F-Package and Function from Verkauf and download the package Spec.
* Run the Pl/Sql Parser as stub against this package locally.
* Develop a first Suggestion for target code of a Java F-Package Layer for selected Package and Function.
* Optional : Implement a narrowed down Generator based on the Pl/sql Parser for the target code
* Findings and suggested further steps
